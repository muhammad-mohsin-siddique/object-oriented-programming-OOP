# Decisions and Iteration #

**Decision**

The conditional statements (also known as decision control structures) such as if, if else, switch, etc. are used for decision-making purposes in C/C++ programs.

They are also known as Decision-Making Statements and are used to evaluate one or more conditions and make the decision whether to execute a set of statements or not. These decision-making statements in programming languages decide the direction of the flow of program execution.
