## Three Important Pillars of Programming ##

1. Data Storage 
2. Iteration
3. Decisions


# Object Oriented Programming #

Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

# Data Types in C++ #

Data types in C++ are declarations for variables that determine the type and size of data associated with them. There are three main types of data types in C++:

**Primitive data types:** 

These are built-in or predefined data types that can be used directly by the user to declare variables. Examples are int, char, float, bool, etc

# Functions Prototype #

In computer programming, a function prototype or function interface is a declaration of a function that specifies the function’s name and type signature. Do not include the function's body at this time.
